See also hand.\n\n\"The handwriting used in manuscripts. Medieval script was subject to greater discipline and more rigid rules and hierarchies than modern personal handwriting, for in early book production such professional or semi-professional handwriting had to serve many of the functions of modern print. The form and function of a book determined the overall appearance of a script - its \naspect - the speed and care with which the letters were formed - its ductus - and the number of space-saving devices employed (notably abbreviations). Seldom was the same grade of script used for, say, a liturgical manuscript and a document or school book. The cut and thickness of the pen nib alters the appearance and degree of formality of a script; and writing materials generally influenced the development of letter forms. Majuscule scripts employ what can be thought of as \'uppercase\' letters and are of generally even height. This script is also termed bilinear, because the letters are confined between two horizontal lines. Minuscule scripts are \'lowercase\', with longer strokes (ascenders and descenders) that extend above and below the body of the letter (as in d and q) and touch on four lines (quadrilinear script).\n\nInitially majuscule scripts, comprising square and rustic capitals, uncials, and half-uncials, were used for more formal purposes than minuscule, but with the development of Caroline minuscule in Carolingian scriptoria in the late eighth century, even formal scripts were minuscules. The degree of formality now lay in the speed and care with which a script was written. Set scripts were slowly and carefully produced, with the scribe frequently lifting the pen from the writing surface. Cursive scripts were written more rapidly with less lifting and sometimes include loops. Current scripts were the most rapidly written and informal and are often difficult to read. The more formal text scripts are generally termed formal book script, textualis, or textura (or variations such as Gothic black-letter script), while the less formal are termed cursives. The fusion of the formal and cursive styles gave rise to hybrid or bastard scripts. Beginning around 1400, the humanists (see Humanistic) sought to reform medieval scripts, and in so doing laid the foundation for many early typefaces.','<div>Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossS.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</a></i>.&nbsp;Malibu, Calif.: J.

Variable features include the number of leaves used in a quire, the relative disposition of the hair and flesh sides of the parchment, the manner of pricking and ruling (and whether these processes were conducted before or after the leaves were folded, one or more leaves at a time, or with the aid of a template), and how a book was sewn and bound.

The fifteenth-century humanists (see Humanistic) were the first to attempt to distinguish styles of handwriting according to date, but the discipline really began to develop during the second half of the seventeenth century. At this time, Jean Bolland, leader of a group of Flemish Jesuits, was charged by the Holy See with producing an authoritative compendium of saints\' lives. In the process, the Bollandists established criteria for determining the authenticity of documents through the analysis of script. Jean Mabillon, a Benedictine monk of St. Germain des Prčs, then published <i>De re diplomatica</i> (1681), which includes a section on the history of handwriting and uses paleographic means to argue for the validity of certain ancient grants to the Benedictine Order. Mabillon\'s principles for assessing the authenticity of documents gave rise to the formal discipline of paleography (or diplomatic, as it was known until the nineteenth century). Subsequent landmarks in the discipline include the <i>Nouveau traité de diplomatique</i> (1750-65) by the Benedictines René-Prosper Tassin and Charles-François Toustain, Charles-François-Bernard de Montfaucon\'s <i>Palaeographia graeca</i> (1708), and the work of Francesco Scipione Maffei of Verona (1675-1755). The twentieth century has witnessed the development of several major schools of paleography, defined by the approaches of key scholars, such as Ludwig Traube and E. A. Lowe.','Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossP.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</a></i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossO.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">.</a>&nbsp;Malibu, Calif.: J.

Documents continued to be produced by independent scribes in certain areas, although to a very limited extent. Following the rise of the universities around 1200, scribes began to function independently, living alongside each other in urban centres and sometimes joining minor clerical orders. Both men and women served as scribes, and occasionally authors were themselves competent scribes (for example, Petrarch and Christine de Pizan in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, respectively).

The gold leaf could simply be laid down on an area to which a binding medium such as glair or gum (perhaps mixed with honey to prevent it from cracking) had been applied, as was the case during the early Middle Ages; it could also be laid on a raised ground of gesso. In order to enrich the tonality of the gold and to make the areas to which the ground had been applied more visible, a colorant such as bole (a pink earth colour) was often added to the base. Gesso grounds enabled the gilded surface to be tooled. However it was applied, the gold could be burnished or left in its slightly duller state. Gilding formed the first stage in the painting processes of illumination, since it was a messy activity, the gilded area often requiring trimming with a knife.

The oldest Greek paper manuscripts were produced during the ninth century. Paper (carta or charter) was made in Muslim Spain beginning in the late eleventh century. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it was used in Italy and the Mediterranean for merchants\' notes and by notaries for registers; from the thirteenth century on, paper was actually manufactured in Italy. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, production spread to Switzerland, the Rhineland, and France. In England there was limited production in the fifteenth century; only in the mid-sixteenth century was the paper making industry permanently established. (In the late fifteenth century, the famous publisher William Caxton and his colleagues were still largely importing supplies from Italy and France.) Correspondence was often written on paper beginning in the fourteenth century, and paper was commonly used in low-grade books from c. 1400 and in legal documents from the sixteenth century (although parchment also continued to be used). ruling on paper generally consists of frame ruling only. The humanists (see Humanistic) revived hard point ruling for a time, which worked well for parchment but damaged paper. In general, ink or lead point was used for ruling paper codices. In early paper books, quires are often protected by parchment outer sheets or guards.\n\nPaper was traditionally made from cotton or linen rags, although more exotic substances such as silk were often employed in the Orient. The rags were soaked and pulverized until reduced to a pulp and were then placed in a vat with a solution of water and size. A wooden frame strung with wires (producing horizontal laid lines and vertical chain lines) was dipped into the mixture and agitated until the fibres fused to form a sheet of paper. This was then placed between sheets of blotting paper and pressed. The paper produced was then either trimmed or left with its rough (deckle) edge. Paper frames often incorporated wire devices (in the form of designs or monograms), which leave an image in the paper known as a watermark. There exist reference volumes containing reproductions of watermarks from broadly datable or localizable contexts, and it is frequently possible to identify watermarks by matching them against such reproductions.\n\nEarly paper is generally quite resilient, but beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, when book production increased dramatically, wood and other organic pulps were used (either completely or as additives). These substances introduce a level of acidity into the paper which causes it to turn brown and eventually to crumble away, presenting great difficulties in preservation. Modern acid-free papers are now available.','Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossP.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</a></i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossO.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">.</a>&nbsp;Malibu, Calif.: J.

In this context, they identify feast days pertinent to the patron and the region, using different colours to highlight important feasts, such as Christmas or the Annunciation (so-called red-letter days). Calendars vary in accordance with local use, and the deaths and saints\' feasts commemorated often supply valuable evidence of origin and provenance. Private, university, and official administrative texts also included calendars, which enabled the literate community to calculate dates. Calendars were often illuminated, the two most popular schemes being the labours of the months (see occupational calendar) and the zodiacal signs, both ultimately of classical origin but increasingly popular from the ninth century on. Calendars are often accompanied in religious books by devices for calculating movable feasts, such as Easter Tables. Medical and astronomical calendars appear in manuscripts relevant to those disciplines.\n\nThe Middle Ages inherited the Julian (Old Style) calendar introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 B.C. This contained a 365-day year, with an extra day every fourth year to reconcile the calendar with the solar year, calculated as 365 days and 6 hours. The year was divided into twelve months. Each month had named days: Kalends, Nones, and Ides, the unnamed days in between being reckoned backwards from the next Kalends, Nones, or Ides. Some months had dies Aegyptiacae (\'Egyptian\', or unlucky, days). Although commonly used, from Early Christian times these Roman days competed with the ecclesiastical division of the year into weeks, each with seven named days, and with dating by reference to church feasts or occasions such as fairs and rent days.\n\nThe Roman civil year, beginning on January 1, continued to be used until the seventh century, when it was increasingly replaced by the Christian year, calculated from the year of Christ\'s birth, a system initially arising from the Dionysian Easter Table of c. 525 and popularized by the English scholar-theologian Bede during the eighth century. In this system Christmas, the Annunciation (March 25) or, less commonly, Easter marked the start of the year. Whatever the start of the year, the era began with the birth of Christ, the \'year of grace\'.\n\nOther calendrical styles were used in the Middle Ages as alternatives to or in association with the ecclesiastical \'year of grace\'. Among these was the indiction, originally a civil reckoning that computed from 312 A.D. in fifteen-year cycles and was used for privileges and legal documents until relegated to notarial use in the late thirteenth century. Pontifical and regnal years also served calendrical purposes, relating a date to the person under whose jurisdiction the calendar was issued (for example, the second year of the reign of Henry III). Certain administrative offices had their own systems (the English Exchequer\'s financial year ran from Michaelmas, September 29, to Michaelmas). Spain, Portugal, and southwestern France used the Spanish Era calendar, beginning on January 1, 38 B.C., which survived in some areas until the fifteenth century.\n\nThe inclusion of devices such as the Golden Number, Epacts, Dominical letters, and Concurrents for the calculation of movable feasts (often added as tables) rendered a calendar perpetual or continually functional. The calculations were mostly concerned with establishing the relationship between the solar year and the phases of the moon so that the date of Easter could be determined.

Some of the major astronomical texts to appear in illuminated copies include: Cicero\'s Aratea, written in the first century B.C., a Latin translation of a third-century B.C. Greek verse text by Aratus, in turn based on a prose treatise, the Phoenomena, written by Eudoxus of Cnidos a century earlier; Ptolemy\'s Almagest (c. 142 A.D.); and later medieval compositions, such as John Foxton\'s Liber Cosmographiae. See also medical texts and computus texts.\n\nAstronomy (the observation of the stars, or \'natural astrology\') was not originally distinguished from astrology (divination by means of the observation of the stars, or \'judicial astrology\'). In the fourth century B.C., for example, Aristotle used \'astrology\' to embrace both subjects. The Mesopotamians and Egyptians were instrumental in the early development of astronomy and astrology and identified each of the heavenly bodies with specific gods. Their practices were transmitted to the Greek and Roman worlds and subsequently to Islam and the medieval West. The study of both astronomy and astrology declined in the first Christian centuries, the latter because its system of prognostication ran counter to the preordained plan of Christian salvation. In the Carolingian period, however, with its revival of classical texts, both subjects were taken up again. As a result, certain works, such as calendars and horoscopes, were used in \nconjunction with both astronomical and astrological material.\n\nFrom the twelfth century, Arabic learning, which had preserved aspects of classical knowledge in astronomy and astrology as well as other subjects, increasingly influenced the West. Western thinkers became interested in the works of Eudoxus, Ptolemy, and Al-Bitruji (fl. c. 1190), and by the thirteenth century a controversy even arose (in which the theologian Albertus Magnus and the philosopher-scientist Roger Bacon played an important part) concerning the respective merits of the ancient and Arabic authors. The rise of new methods of astronomy during the fifteenth century and the 1543 publication of Nicolaus Copernicus\' theory that the earth revolved around the sun did much to damage the academic credibility of astrology, but it continued to exert an influence within society. Moreover, there was never a clear-cut division between works in these fields and those dealing with experimental science, alchemy, and magic.','Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossA.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</a></i>.

The rising of the phoenix from the pyre, for example, is related to Christ\'s Resurrection.\n\nThe bestiary, in all its varied manifestations, enjoyed great popularity during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, especially in England. Among the most beloved of picture books, a favourite of the literate laity, it functioned as a library and school book and as homiletic source material. The text was frequently illustrated, in styles catering to a variety of purses, and motifs drawn from it are widely encountered in other decorative contexts, including bas-de-page scenes, heraldry, and encyclopaedic world maps (see mappa mundi ). \n\nThe core of the text originated in the writings of authors such as Herodotus, Aristotle, and Pliny the Elder, and in a Greek text known as the \nPhysiologus (The Natural Philosopher), which is thought to have been compiled in Alexandria around the second century by a Christian ascetic. In the Physiologus, discussions of the characteristics of almost fifty creatures, plants, and stones, along with the etymologies of their names, were distilled from classical mythology and the Christian tradition.\n\nThe Physiologus was influential for a thousand years, being translated into Arabic, Armenian, Ethiopic, Syriac, and other vernacular languages; the later medieval bestiaries descended primarily from a variable Latin translation that was available from at least the fifth century. Several more beasts and additional material were conflated with the Latin Physiologus from the Etymologies of the seventh-century Spanish bishop Isidore of Seville and other selected sources. From this expanded text, Philippe de Thaon produced a rhyming version in Anglo-Norman (c. 1125), dedicated to Aelis (or Adela) de Louvain, second wife of Henry I of England; this version gave rise to the popular medieval Bestiaire. Other medieval versions include that of Gervaise, written in French (perhaps in Normandy) in the thirteenth century; that of Guillaume le Clerc (the most popular version), written in the early thirteenth century in French by a Norman priest working in England; and two versions ascribed to Pierre de Beauvais, \'le Picard\', composed in the dialect of Picardy, also in the early thirteenth century. The Latin bestiary still flourished alongside its French counterparts and was often produced in luxurious illustrated copies in England during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. These are grouped into two important families on the basis of variations in their texts and programs of illumination.','Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossB.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</a></i>.

The private recitation of the Little Office of the Virgin is an expression of the lay person\'s desire to imitate the prayer-life of the religious.\n\nThe Little Office of the Virgin gradually acquired other elements: a liturgical calendar, a litany of the saints, suffrages, the Office of the Dead (which had emerged by the ninth century), the Penitential Psalms (Psalms 6, 31, 37, 50, 101, 129, and 142, which were first included in books of hours in the thirteenth century), the Gradual Psalms (Psalms 119-133), and prayers. Additional offices, such as the Short Office of the Cross, Hours of the Holy Spirit, Hours of the Trinity, and Hours of the Passion, could also form part of a book of hours. The book of hours took its standard form in the thirteenth century and continued in general use until the sixteenth century, enjoying particular popularity in France and Flanders. The texts of books of hours vary slightly in accordance with use.\n\nBooks of hours were medieval best-sellers and have survived in relatively high quantity. They are nearly always illuminated, in a manner commensurate with the patron\'s budget, and often contain a miniature or set of miniatures for each major textual division.

Such recordings developed from the practice of annotating Easter Tables (see calendar). Early chronicles took the form of world or universal histories, such as those written in the fourth century by Eusebius of Caesarea and Sulpicius Severus. Local chronicles began to appear in the ninth century: among the most notable are the Annals of Ulster, the Frankish Royal Annals, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and a history of the Saxon kings by the German bishop Thietmar of Merseburg in the early eleventh century. World chronicles continued to be written, however, perpetuated by historians such as Marianus Scotus in the later eleventh century. The Historia ecclesiastica, completed in 731 at Jarrow in northeastern England by the Venerable Bede, marked an influential new approach to the writing of history: Bede perceived a relationship of cause and effect between events, collated material in accordance with a central theme (the growth of Christianity in England), and promoted a consistent system of dating (from the Incarnation).\n\nThe Normans produced a number of historical works relating to Normandy, England, and the Holy Land in the later eleventh and twelfth centuries; these include the Gesta Normannorum ducum of William of Jumičges, the Gesta Guillelmi ducis \nNormannorum et regis Anglorum of William of Poitiers, and the works of Sigebert of Gembloux, Robert of Torigni, and Ordericus Vitalis. History writing in Britain continued to proliferate throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, with chronicles by Florence of Worcester, William of Malmesbury, Geoffrey of Monmouth, Gerald of Wales, and Matthew Paris. Important Continental historians of the thirteenth century include Salimbene (Cronica) and Vincent of Beauvais (Speculum historiale), the latter representing a move toward a more encyclopaedic world view. Histories based on the Bible, such as the thirteenth-century Weltchronik of Rudolf von Ems, were also compiled. The thirteenth century also witnessed a proliferation of Vernacular histories, among them Villehardouin\'s Conquęte de Constantinople, the Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal, the Grandes Chroniques françaises de Saint-Denis, Jean Creton\'s Histoire de Roy d\'Angleterre Richard, and Jean Froissart\'s Chroniques \nde France, d\'Engleterre et des paďs voisins, the last representing a fusion of the traditional chronicle with the Romance genre.\n\nDuring the Gothic period, many historical works were illustrated, a practice largely initiated in England by Giraldus Cambrensis and Matthew Paris, who incorporated marginal drawings into some of their works. In the thirteenth century, some authors attempted to integrate pagan and Christian history by grafting books such as Peter of Poitiers\' Genealogy of Christ onto universal chronicles. The genealogies of kings were also included, giving rise to a tradition of illuminated genealogical manuscripts, often in roll form.','Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossC.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</a></i>.

Purple pages were introduced in Byzantine books at least as early as the sixth century as a more suitable and luxurious background for such script; the imperial connotation of having been \'born to the purple\' was implicit in the ostentatious use of the colour. Chrysography was practiced in Insular, Anglo-Saxon, Carolingian, and Ottonian luxury book production and also occurs sporadically later in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Gold ink was also used in Byzantine illumination to provide highlights (especially in articulating drapery) and other details, a technique transmitted to the West, where it enjoyed particular popularity during the fifteenth century.

Islam also became the custodian of a significant body of classical texts, notably the works of Plato, Aristotle, Galen of Pergamon, and Hippocrates, which it transmitted to the West beginning in the twelfth century, contributing to the rise of scholasticism.

Decretals may be illuminated with scenes germane to the text or with scenes designed to relieve the text, such as bas-de-page scenes narrating saints\' lives or amusing scenes from daily life and grotesques. Copies of decretals were often required by ecclesiastical and civil authorities or for study purposes in universities, notably those specializing in law, such as the university at Bologna.\n\nThe earliest decretals were simple collections of papal letters. They were often included in collections of canon law and as early as the fifth century were themselves arranged in collections. Among the most notable are: the Colleclio Dionysiana of Dionysius Exiguus, compiled c. 514; Pope Hadrian I\'s collection, sent to Charlemagne in 774 (Collectio Dionysio-Hadriana), which became the authoritative Frankish text on canon law; the Spanish sixth-century collection associated with Isidore of Seville (Hispana collectio); the Fake Decretals of Pseudo-Isidore, compiled in France around 850; the ninth-century Italian Anselmo dedicata colleclio; the tenth-century Collectio of Abbo of Fleury; Regino of Prüm\'s collection of canon laws made in 906; the Decretum of Burchard of Worms, c. 1012, an influential collection designed to promote church reorganization; and the late eleventh-century Decretum of Ivo of Chartres. Gratian\'s Decretum of c. 1140 summarized older letters and conciliar decrees and became the most important law book of the twelfth century. It marked the end of the traditional form of collection, giving rise to the greatest period of legal scholarship in the Roman Church. Later collections include the Quinque compilationes antiquae; the Decretals of Pope Gregory IX of 1234, an important new edition of canon law; the Liber sextus of Pope Boniface VIII of 1298; and the Constitutiones Clementinae of Pope Clement V of 1317. Decretals generated a number of commentaries, which often appeared as glosses.','Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossD.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</a></i>.

In the fourth century, under the influence of Saint Ambrose, hymns and antiphons were added; one hundred and fifty years later, under Saint Benedict, there appeared responsories, canticles, collects, and other elaborations. By the eighth century, the cycle of eight canonical hours for the performance of the Divine Office had been fixed: matins (approximately 2:30 am), lauds (approximately 5 am), prime (approximately 6 am), terce (approximately 9 am), sext (approximately 12 noon), none (approximately 3 pm), vespers (approximately 4:30 pm), and compline (approximately 6 pm).\n\nThe Divine Office was initially arranged so that the complete Psalter could be recited each week, and much of Holy Scripture throughout the year. During the Middle Ages, however, the celebration of saints\' feast days and readings from their lives (see Martyrology) interfered with this structure, stimulating attempts at reform in the sixteenth century.

The psalter was the principal book for private devotions before the emergence of the Book of Hours in the thirteenth century. The Psalms also formed a major part of many medieval prayer books from the ninth century on. In the non-monastic Roman liturgy of the Middle Ages, all one hundred and fifty Psalms were recited each week, the majority at matins and vespers. The cycle began at matins on Sunday with Psalm 1 and continued at matins on the following days: Psalm 26 was the first recited on Monday, Psalm 38 the first on Tuesday, Psalm 52 the first on Wednesday, Psalm 68 the first on Thursday, Psalm 80 the first on Friday, Psalm 97 the first on Saturday. The cycle for vespers commenced on Sunday with Psalm 109 and continued throughout the week with the remaining Psalms (some Psalms were set aside for other hours). Other divisions of the Psalms are occasionally found, such as the Irish division of the three fifties (beginning at Psalms 1, 51, and 101). Such divisions would often be given prominence within the decorative program.\n\nDepictions of King David, author of many of the Psalms, frequently introduce the psalter (especially as historiated Beatus initials to Psalm 1), and prefatory cycles were often added, along with an illuminated calendar.

Medieval herbals were frequently illustrated. The study of plants formed part of natural philosophy during antiquity. Among the major authors of botanical texts written from the fourth century B.C. to the fourth century A.D. are Aristotle, Theophrastus (Historia plantarum), Hippocrates, Crateuas, Pliny the Elder (Historia naturalis), Dioscorides (De materia medica), and Pseudo-Apuleius Platonicus (Herbarium). Several of these works were probably illustrated during Antiquity. Southern Italy (especially centres such as Squillace, Monte Cassino, and Salerno) preserved the classical interest in botany and its medicinal application into the Middle Ages. The Carolingian and Anglo-Saxon worlds did much to perpetuate interest in several botanical texts (notably the works of Dioscorides and Pseudo-Apuleius), England producing the first vernacular translation of the Herbarium, perhaps as early as 1000. These early medieval copies contain cycles of illustrations which seem to represent for the most part copies of Antique cycles. It is clear from the errors in these depictions that the illuminators had no direct knowledge of some of the plants, and they retained images of classical deities such as Diana, Asclepius (god of medicine), and Mercury as well as the centaur Chiron, legendary teacher of Asclepius.\n\nIlluminated herbals continued to be produced throughout the Middle Ages primarily as library books, and their illustrations became progressively more stylized. The Islamic world, however, had also preserved - and expanded - knowledge of classical botany, which from the late eleventh century on was transmitted to the West. At the medical school of Salerno in the mid-twelfth century, the Circa instans, containing remedies, or simples, from Latin and Arabic sources, was compiled. Some manuscripts of the Circa instans (also known as the Liber simplici medicina or Secreta salernitana) and the slightly later Tacuinum sanitatis, from northern Italy, have illustrations of plants based on the direct observation of nature rather than on images in earlier herbals. This more scientific trend was perpetuated in works such as the Herbolario volgare (Popular Herbal), an Italian translation by Jacopo Filippo of an Arabic treatise by Serapion the Younger, and initiated the Renaissance tradition of naturalistically illustrated herbals.

Further divisions are the Common of Saints (standard formulae for saints who were not accorded individual services) and votive masses for special occasions, such as marriage. The Te igitur and Vere dignum openings were principal vehicles for illumination.\n\nSeveral distinct rites were current in the West before c. 700, the two most influential being the Roman and the Gallican. The former was followed in Rome and southern Italy and the latter in much of the rest of Western Europe. By 700 the Roman sacramentary had reached Gaul, where it was modified by Gallican usage. This mixture of rites resulted in the Gelasian Sacramentary (spuriously attributed to the late fifth-century Pope Gelasius I). As part of his efforts to standardize church ritual in the Carolingian period, Charlemagne asked Pope Hadrian I to provide an authentic Roman sacramentary for use throughout the empire. In 785-86, the pope sent the emperor the Sacramentarium Hadrianum, also known as the Gregorian Sacramentary. This, however, was a special sacramentary for papal use. In order to adapt it for general use, scholars such as Alcuin of York and Benedict of Aniane added supplementary material drawn from the Gallican and Gelasian rites. By the late thirteenth century, the sacramentary had virtually been replaced by the Missal.','Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossS.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</a></i>.&nbsp;Malibu, Calif.: J.

Depictions of musicians and instruments frequently appear in medieval manuscripts as drolleries and in initials and bas-de-page scenes.\n\nMusic was incorporated into the Christian liturgy early on, influenced by the use of music in the synagogue. The study of music theory was part of the Antique and medieval Liberal Arts syllabus. Plainchant (unison singing, originally unaccompanied) was the traditional music of the western Church. From about 1000, vocal polyphony (music with two or more melodically independent parts) was being practiced at Winchester in England. A particularly rich repertoire of polyphony came from the cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris. Polyphony made certain chants of the Mass longer and more complex. From the mid-thirteenth century on, liturgical polyphony shared a number of characteristics with secular music.\n\nThere is little early written evidence for secular music, although there was probably a rich oral tradition, but collections of the songs of troubadours and trouvčres survive from the mid-thirteenth century on, by which time the courtly poet-composer had achieved professional status.\n\nThe notation of liturgical music initially appears in the form of neumes - graphic symbols written above the text and indicating the rise and fall of melodic movement or repetitions of the same pitch. Twelve to fifteen regional families of neumes have been identified. They were commonly written on a four-line staff beginning in the mid-eleventh century. Two hundred years later, eastern European music manuscripts adopted Gothic notation, produced with a thick, square-cut nib, with the points and curves of earlier neumes being replaced by broader, more angular forms. A similar development in the Île de France gave rise to the use of square notation in the late twelfth century, especially in France and Italy. Alphabetical notation is also sporadically encountered from antiquity on in a theoretical context.

The paints used in illumination consist of vegetable, mineral, and animal extracts, ground or soaked out and mixed with glair as a binding medium, perhaps with some glue and water added. Other additives were also used, including stale urine, honey, and ear wax, to modify colour, texture, and opacity; inert whites such as chalk, eggshell, or white lead were added to increase opacity. Some pigments were obtained locally (such as turnsole, or crozophora tinctona); others were exotic imports (such as ultramarine, made from lapis lazuli imported from Persia or Afghanistan). During the early Middle Ages, scribes and/or illuminators ground and prepared their own pigments, perhaps with the aid of an assistant, but with the growth of specialized, more commercial production around 1200, they often purchased their ingredients in prepared form from a stationer or an apothecary. With the rise of experimental science and international trade in the fourteenth century, many colours were added to the traditional palette, which significantly affected styles of illumination. The production of synthetically manufactured pigments (such as mercury-based vermilion and copper blues) and imports (such as saffron yellow from crocus stamens and red lakes from Brazil woods largely imported from Ceylon) increased at this time.\n\nPigments are difficult to identify precisely without chemical analysis, although other techniques of analysis, such as radiospectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence, as well as reconstructions from medieval recipes, are advancing rapidly. Some pigments also change in a consistent fashion over time: for example, the red lead often used for rubrics frequently fades and turns silver-black through oxidation, and copper-based verdigris green sometimes eats through the support as it corrodes.','Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossP.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</a></i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossO.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">.</a>&nbsp;Malibu, Calif.: J.

The Old French word romanz originally denoted texts in the French vernacular but later came to be applied to narrative tales of the deeds of noblemen and noblewomen. Romances were frequently illustrated, sometimes modestly, but often lavishly if the patron was wealthy. The combination of imaginative stories of chivalric love and heroism with details from everyday courtly life (which abound in the illustrations) contributed to the popularity of the romance, as did the rise in secular literacy and patronage.\n\nMost examples of the romance can be termed romans d\'aventures (\'chivalric romances\'), since their major theme is hazardous adventure. Early romances are generally in verse, but prose romances (such as the French Arthurian cycle) also proliferated. Among the earliest romances are those written in the later twelfth century by Chrétien de Troyes, who transformed mere incident into meaningful action by stressing moral themes, as in <i>Erec et Enide</i>, one of his first works in the genre. Although fictional, romances were often based on historical events, either classical (<i>King Alisaunder</i>) or medieval (<i>Lai d\'Haveloc</i> and <i>Le Morte Arthur</i>). Love - as perceived in a rigid system of chivalric behavior - often plays a role in French works, one of the most popular being the Roman de la rose, begun by Guillaume de Lorris (c. 1237) and completed by Jean de Meun (c. 1275), which combines the allegorical and satirical with courtly love and human emotions.','Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossR.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</a></i>.&nbsp;Malibu, Calif.: J.

The gradual substitution of sheets of parchment for wood or ivory may well have stimulated the development of the codex form. Tablets continued to be used into the twentieth century for informal financial accounts (by French fishermen, for example). During the Middle Ages, they fulfilled a variety of functions: drafting texts; trying out artistic designs; recording liturgical commemorations; note taking during study; accounting and legal contexts; as proto-Filofaxes; and as love tokens filled with amorous poetry. Tablets ranged in format from robust teaching tablets to portable girdle books. Although different colours of wax were used, black and green predominated.

The texts of the Mass and the Divine Office and their ordering throughout the year varied in accordance with these rites, with celebrations relating to local saints being particularly variable. The inclusion of local saints in calendars and litanies can provide useful clues as to use. During the later Middle Ages, some uses were codified by cathedrals or major religious orders (such as the Sarum rite of Salisbury and the Paris rite) and consequently spread beyond their region of origin. In the sixteenth century, as part of the general spirit of Catholic reform, the Council of Trent (1545-63) abolished uses that were less than two hundred years old in favour of Roman use; in Protestant England, the Book of Common Prayer (1549) mandated the observation of one use throughout the realm.\n\nIn addition to a consideration of regional saints, use can be established by comparing certain elements of the text, such as the Psalm antiphons and the capitula for the hours of prime and none (see Divine Office) to examples of known uses, but more reliable systems for identifying lesser-known uses continue to be explored.','Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossU.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</i></a>.&nbsp;Malibu, Calif.: J.

During this time, England was largely occupied and ruled by Germanic peoples, primarily the Angles and the Saxons. Prior to the Viking incursions of the ninth century, the culture of England interacted closely with that of Celtic Britain and Ireland. The art produced during the four centuries from c. 550 to 900 is often termed Insular, reflecting this interaction among the peoples inhabiting the regions that we know as the British Isles and Ireland. With reference to Illumination, the term Anglo-Saxon is often reserved for the period after 900.\n\nDuring the tenth century, two major Anglo-Saxon painting styles developed, largely under the influence of Insular and Carolingian models. The first, or Winchester, style is so named because certain of its key examples, such as the Benedictional of Saint Ethelwold, were probably made at Winchester, even though the style was diffused throughout the region. It is characterized by an opulent manner of painting, with rich \ncolours and gilding (unless executed in a tinted or outline drawing style), a naturalistic figure style, fluttering, decorative drapery, and a heavy acanthus-like ornament. This style exhibits the influence of Carolingian art, specifically the Court School of Charlemagne, the School of Metz, and the Franco-Saxon School (which employed interlace motifs ultimately of Insular inspiration), and is also indebted to Byzantine art. The second major style, the Utrecht style, was inspired by the Utrecht Psalter, an important Carolingian manuscript that featured an agitated, sketchy, and illusionistic form of outline drawing \nadopted from classical painting technique. During the first half of the eleventh century, the Winchester and Utrecht styles began to fuse. Scandinavian art also exerted a limited influence during the Anglo-Saxon period.\n\nAnglo-Saxon art continued to exchange influences with art on the Continent and made a significant contribution to the formation of Romanesque art. It also developed a number of sophisticated iconographies, based on interpretative, exegetical literature (important themes include the Trinity, the Crucifixion, the Virgin, the evangelists, and David).','<div>Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossA.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</a></i>.

After the introduction of Norman artists and Scribes into England following the Norman Conquest in 1066, this trend increased, contributing to the development of Romanesque art.','Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossC.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</a></i>.

A term coined in the mid-twentieth century to refer to a style of depicting drapery in which the material appears to cling to the body like wet cloth. The drapery folds not only articulate the human figure but, being sinuous and rhythmical, produce a decorative effect. The style ultimately derives from Byzantine art, but is found in the West from the twelfth century on and is an international feature of Romanesque art. Three variations of damp-fold drapery have been noted: a style composed of concentric lines, particularly favoured in Burgundy in the twelfth century; nested V folds, in which planes of drapery of ovoid or pear shape terminate in a series of V\'s - a widespread convention for rendering hanging drapery; the clinging curvilinear style, characterized by S-shaped lines, which enjoyed its greatest popularity in England, becoming something of a hallmark of English art around 1140-70.

Heraldry developed in the West during the twelfth century and evolved along with concepts of nobility and chivalry during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Military identification symbols had been known in antiquity, but their systematic use emerged as an adjunct to medieval feudalism, serving to identify knights in full armour. Heraldic devices were employed by secular society, by the Church, and by guilds and corporations. By the fourteenth century, strict rules concerning the significance of different components of a coat of arms were in full force.\n\nThe language of heraldry is largely derived from French. There is an elaborate vocabulary for the blazoning (or describing) of a shield, involving its tinctures (colour), charges (geometric patterns, called ordinaries, or the figures or objects depicted), and the way in which the arms are \'differenced\' to indicate collateral branches. Helmets, crests, and supporters (figures such as the lion and the unicorn, supporting the shield) also obey complex rules and nomenclatures. Many illuminated genealogies, pedigrees, and heraldic manuals were produced during the later Middle Ages.

Although we speak of the Carolingian, Northumbrian, and twelfth-century renaissances, the term by itself denotes a two-hundred-year period, from approximately the mid-fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth century, that marks a transition from the Middle Ages to the modern era and is characterized by the revival of the learning of classical Antiquity. Renaissance (originally the Italian rinascimento) was coined by Italian humanists (see Humanistic), who saw their own age as significantly different from the preceding one, which they perceived as Gothic. Working initially in centres such as Florence and Rome, the humanists began to study classical texts, although many of the copies available to them dated no earlier than Carolingian times. In the art of the period, we find a noticeable concern with naturalistic rendering and the use of classical motifs.\n\nA love of decoration remained a feature of Renaissance illumination, but the grotesques of medieval art were replaced by putti, classical masks, vases, jewels, and other motifs. miniatures increasingly reflected the advanced styles of easel and fresco painters (the famous sixteenth-century illuminator Giulio Clovio was known as \'the little Michelangelo\'). Humanist scholars such as Petrarch (1304-1374) and Poggio Bracciolini (1380-1459) were themselves involved in book production, and their reforms of script and promotion of literacy were to play an important role in the early development of printing. Secular patronage was a significant factor in Renaissance book production: kings, princes, and other nobles no less than popes and ecclesiastical leaders throughout Europe used the arts to promote their political and economic status.','Michelle Brown.&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossR.asp\" title=\"Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</a></i>.&nbsp;Malibu, Calif.: J.
