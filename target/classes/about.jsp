			<span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML offers researchers at
			every level of experience the resources and tools they need to work
			with manuscripts. <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML will
			ultimately cover several manuscript cultures from Europe, Africa, the
			Middle East, and South Asia. It makes abundant use of high-resolution
			images of manuscripts from libraries around the world, many of them
			digitized as part of <a href="http://www.hmml.org/" target="_blank">HMML</a>&#8217;s
			mission to preserve and share important, endangered, and inaccessible
			manuscript collections through digital photography, archiving, and
			cataloging.
			<p>
				Introductions to each component of <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML
				are readily available as you explore.

			<span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML is an initiative of
			the <a href="http://www.hmml.org/" target="_blank">Hill Museum
				<span class="redtext">&amp;</span> Manuscript Library</a>. The project began as a partnership between
			HMML and developers from the Center for Digital Humanities at Saint
			Louis University (James Ginther, <abbr title="principal investigator">PI</abbr>)
			and the Carolingian Canon Law Project at the University of Kentucky
			(Abigail Firey, PI), with initial support from a 2012 National
			Leadership Grant by the Institute of Museum and Library Services,
			supplemented by Arcadia.
			<p>
				Guidance during the development phase was provided by the <span
					class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML Council in three annual
				meetings held each August from 2012-2014. The <span
					class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML Council included HMML
				staff, scholars representing both Western and Eastern Christian
				manuscript studies, an advisor in web-based instruction, the co-PIs
				from Saint Louis University and the University of Kentucky, and
				developers from both of those institutions.
			</p>
			<p>
				The original workplan was for the Saint Louis team to work on
				School, Lexicon, Reference (then called Library), and Folio, while
				the team at the University of Kentucky would focus on Scriptorium,
				the most complex part of the project. After the second Council
				meeting in August 2013, Folio moved to Kentucky to be developed
				along with Scriptorium. By fall 2014, having exhausted their portion
				of the grant funding, the team at SLU determined that they had to
				discontinue work on their components of <span
					class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML. After a period of
				assessment and consultation, HMML retained <a
					href="http://solutiondesign.com/" target="_blank">Solution
					Design Group (sdg)</a> of Golden Valley, Minnesota, who worked with
				HMML staff to redevelop School, Lexicon and Reference. The team at
				the University of Kentucky completed Folio in 2015. As the launch
				date for <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML drew closer,
				it became clear that the potential of Scriptorium could be better
				realized if it remained at the University of Kentucky as a resource
				for Digital Humanities projects beyond the scope of <span
					class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML. Folio was the first
				resource created using Scriptorium's rich suite of tools.
			</p>
			<p>Concurrently HMML was developing the concept of a virtual
				Reading Room, which in turn led to a plan for a comprehensive
				makeover of OLIVER, a manuscript catalog first developed in the late
				1990s. These two additional projects were driven by the imperative
				to make HMML&#8217;s digital collections more easily and
				comprehensively available. The goal is free access to complete
				manuscripts for registered users, supported by greatly improved
				metadata, search functionality, and a hospitable means for
				submitting corrections or additions to existing cataloging.</p>
			<p>
				Content for <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML has been
				created by a team of scholars with expertise in the various
				manuscript cultures represented in the project. HMML staff worked on
				Lexicon and Reference, and we gratefully acknowledge the generous
				permission of the British Library to use Michelle Brown&#8217;s
				definitions of manuscript terminology from the online version of <a
					href="http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossA.asp"
					target="_blank"><em>Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts</em>
					(1994)</a>. Content for Latin School and for Latin manuscripts in Folio
				was created by Carin Ruff (Washington, DC). As the pioneer content
				creator, Carin developed the basic schema used throughout <span
					class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML School. Syriac School and
				associated manuscripts in Folio were the work of Adam McCollum, at
				that time Lead Cataloger of Eastern Christian Manuscripts at HMML.
			</p>
			<h3 id="FUNDING" class="subheading jumptarget">Funding</h3>
			<span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML has relied on the
			generous support of many donors, both institutional and individual.
			Initial funding came from a National Leadership Grant awarded by the
			Institute of Museum and Library Services, a federal agency. The
			project received significant contributed funding and services from
			Saint Louis University and the University of Kentucky Research
			Foundation during the initial development phase. Further funding for
			<span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML has been provided by
			the <a href="http://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/" target="_blank">Arcadia
				Fund</a> of London and by generous individual donors.
			<p>
				Creation of Reading Room has been made possible by a grant from the
				Theology Program of the <a href="http://www.hluce.org/home.aspx"
					target="_blank">Henry Luce Foundation</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The redevelopment of the manuscript catalog (OLIVER) has been
				supported by a grant from the Scholarly Communications Program of
				the <a href="https://mellon.org/" target="_blank">Andrew W.
					Mellon Foundation</a>.
			</p>
			<h3 id="PEOPLE" class="subheading jumptarget">People</h3>
			HMML staff working on the project have included Columba Stewart, OSB, Project Director; Daniel Gullo (from 2014), Matthew Heintzelman, Adam McCollum (until 2015), Eileen Smith (from 2015), 
			William Straub (from 2014), Wayne Torborg, and Theresa Vann (until 2013). Members of the <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML Council have included the original co-PIs, James Ginther (then of Saint Louis University) and Abigail Firey (University of Kentucky), as well as Wil Hawk (Baltimore, MD), Scott Johnson (Georgetown University), 
			Ellen Joyce (Beloit College), Joel Kalvesmaki (Dumbarton Oaks), Carin Ruff (Washington, DC), Andrew Scheil (University of Minnesota). The original landing page image and the color palette were the work of Alan Reed, OSB.
			The original Folio design template was created by <a href="http://differential.com/"
			target="_blank">Differential</a> (Cincinnati, OH) in 2013-2014. For the initial release of <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML in 2015, Daniel Gullo, William Straub, and Columba Stewart based the site design on Differential's template. 
			For the release of Reading Room and a new version of Folio in 2016, they developed a new <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML template with assistance provided by  <a href="http://shinebox.com/" target="_blank">Shinebox</a> (Minneapolis, MN).
