<h2><span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML Sign in Help </h2>
	
<p>Many of the manuscripts in <span
				class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/readingRoom">Reading Room</a> are available for viewing only by registered users. 
				This is a requirement of the owning libraries so that readers are aware of certain rights reserved by those institutions. 
				Registration is <em>one-time</em> and <em>no-cost</em>. Once you have created an account and it has been confirmed by HMML, 
				you will be able to sign in and browse everything in Reading Room. 
	</p>
<h3>Having trouble signing in?</h3>
<ul> 
	<li>Check to make sure that you are <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/registration">registered</a>. </li>
	<li>Try closing your browser (quit) and then restarting it. </li>
	<li>Try to <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/login">sign in</a> again.</li>
	<li>If you have forgotten your password, you can  <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/user/forgotPassword">reset it</a>. 
	Please note that HMML staff are unable to reset your password for you nor can we see your password since it is encrypted.</li>
